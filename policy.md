## Privacy Policy

This applies only to the speak.sarkar.icu service.

This service may be used for the purpose of sharing important news and information when immediate access to broadband or mobile internet is not available. Messages shared using this service will be immediately available on the public board located at speak.sarkar.icu

## Privacy

The phone number (or “Sender ID”) for each message will be masked by default. Only the last four digits of the Sender ID will be displayed on the board. This is done in order to protect the privacy of individuals interacting with the service.

## Abuse

This service is intended for use by individuals affected by network shutdowns, who wish to share important news or information with those who can access internet services. Messages containing inflammatory content may be removed from public view on the board. The reason for deletion would then replace the content of the message.
